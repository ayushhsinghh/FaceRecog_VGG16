# Face_Recognition_VGG16
This repository shows how we can use transfer learning in keras with the example of training a face recognition model using VGG-16 pre-trained weights.
Transfer learning refers to the technique of using knowledge of one domain to another domain.i.e. a NN model trained on one dataset can be used for other dataset by fine-tuning the former network.

We have Used 11 Different Faces to Train this Model(Including Mine). We have Used The Pre-trained Weights of VGG16 in Our model.
